# snake in a qr code

it's literally the classic snake game but squished into a qr code. 8KB uncompressed, under 3KB compressed.

there's also the "essence of bad apple" in it, meaning just the tune from part of the song, on loop, forever. it will drive you crazy.

script is in `script.js`, `preview.html` can be used to preview the site uncompressed, and `index.ts` is a script that minifies the code and adds the required prefix. run index.ts with deno `deno run index.ts` to minify the code.
