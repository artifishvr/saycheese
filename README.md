# snake in a qr code

it's literally the classic snake game but squished into a qr code. 8KB uncompressed, under 3KB compressed.

script is in `script.js`, `preview.html` can be used to preview the site uncompressed, and `index.ts` is a script that minifies the code and adds the required prefix. run index.ts with deno `deno run index.ts` to minify the code.
